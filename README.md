# Learning-Rust-Journey
Documentation my journey of learning Rust to see how I progress and to see if I give up

Moved this to per project crate as that would be cleaner but the initial ones remain here for fun

# October
## 23rd
- Took a day off work to chill a bit from burnout.
- Set up the GitHub repo so I can track progress (and also get a few cheeky green boxes active on github)
- Realized NotebookLM is useless at rust, pretty much all LLMs are so I decided to go old school with the learning (Hello Reddit and Stackoverflow)
- 

## 19th:
- Sunday, started my journey
- Got all my resources set up (NotebookLM project + the book)
- Covered Rust IDEs
- Rust Intro
- fn main(), println!, print, let, scopes, warnings, panic, assert_eq!()


# Fun Notes that I picked up along the way
- Rust uses 4 spaces, not a tab
- All items with ! are called "Macros", not a function i.e println!() is a macro, main() is a function
- Cargo is Rust's package manager, like python has pip
- cargo build --release for shipping, optimizes the build and take a bit long to compile.. Pretty nifty ngl
